Hello there.  I grew up in Iowa and am proud to call myself an _Iowan_.  Presently, I am a graduate Computer Science student at Iowa State University.  My research interests include Program Analysis, Compilers, High-Performance Computing, and Computer Architecture.  Apart from academia, I find enjoyment in exploring a myriad of hobbies.  I'm passionate about computers, Open Source projects, 3D printing, mechanical keyboards, motorcycles, soccer, and hiking.

## Career

I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to participate in several internships throughout my time studying Computer Science.  In May of 2021, I began my first internship as a Software Engineer.  It was a 7-month Co-Op at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  At Collins I supported the verification effort of flight deck software for the Tuning and Control Panel (TCP-2100) and the Display and Crew Alerting Systems (DCA) for Boeing 787 and 777x.  After my Co-Op I kept working for Collins part-time while enrolled in classes before transferring to Raytheon Missiles & Defense the following summer for an internship.  Most recently, I joined a Pre-Silicon Verification team with Arm’s Architecture & Technology Group in Austin, Texas.  There I contributed to the development of an advanced dynamic random test generator that is used extensively by CPU design teams throughout the Arm ecosystem.


## What's next for me?

In May of 2024 I will return for another internship with Arm continuing work in Pre-Silicon Verification.  After that I will return to Iowa State University to complete the final semester of my Master's degree.  I am pursuing employment upon completion of my Master's degree.


## Why I Write?

Writing is a powerful tool for rationalizing one's opinions.  I write as a way to explore different points of view and share ideas I find interesting.  I think this excerpt best summarizes my motivations for writing.
