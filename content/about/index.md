Hello there.  I grew up in Iowa and am currently a graduate Computer Science student at Iowa State University.  My research interests include Program Analysis, Compilers, High-Performance Computing, and Computer Architecture.  I find enjoyment in exploring a myriad of hobbies.  I'm passionate about computers, open-source projects, 3D printing, mechanical keyboards, motorcycles, soccer, and hiking.

## Career

I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to participate in several internships throughout my time studying Computer Science.  In May of 2021, I began my first internship as a Software Engineer.  It was a 7-month Co-Op at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  At Collins, I supported the verification effort of flight deck software for the Tuning and Control Panel (TCP-2100) and the Display and Crew Alerting Systems (DCA) for Boeing 787 and 777x.  After my Co-Op, I kept working for Collins part-time while enrolled in classes before moving to Arizona the following summer for an internship with Raytheon Missiles & Defense.  At Raytheon, I fixed bugs, vulnerabilities, and other weaknesses in embedded software identified by static analysis tools.  Most recently, I joined a Pre-Silicon Verification team with Arm’s Architecture & Technology Group in Austin, Texas.  There, I contributed to the development of an advanced dynamic random test generator that is used extensively by CPU design teams throughout the Arm ecosystem.

## What’s Next for Me?

In May 2024, I will return for a second internship with Arm, continuing work in Pre-Silicon Verification.  After that, I will return to Iowa State University to complete the final semester of my Master's degree.  I am pursuing employment upon completion of my Master's degree.


## Why I Write

Writing is a powerful tool for rationalizing one's opinions.  I write as a way to explore different points of view and share ideas I find interesting.  I think this excerpt best summarizes my motivations for writing.
