My name is Luke Marzen and I am a Software Engineer at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/) and a recent Computer Science Master's graduate from Iowa State University.
My research interests include Program Analysis, Compilers, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Computer Architecture.
Outside of work, I’m passionate about exploring new technologies, whether it’s tinkering with 3D printing, building mechanical keyboards, or contributing to open-source projects.
When I’m not behind a screen, I enjoy the thrill of riding motorcycles, playing soccer, and hiking in the great outdoors.

## Career

In January 2025, I began my current role with __Arm__ as a __Graduate Software Engineer__, contributing to the development of Raven.
Raven is a dynamic random test generator written in modern C++, widely used by CPU design teams across the Arm ecosystem.
My responsibilities include designing new features, debugging complex issues, and supporting Raven's use for A, R, and M-class cores.
In this role I leverage my expertise in C++ and computer architecture as I collaborate with engineers to tackle challenging verification problems.

<!-- I’ve had the opportunity to debug intricate issues, engage in technical discussions, and support users through training. -->

During my time in school I completed four interships/co-ops amounting to nearly two years of experience.
In May of 2021, I began my first co-op as a __Software Engineer__ at __Collins Aerospace__ in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
At Collins, I supported the verification effort of flight deck software for the Tuning and Control Panel (TCP-2100) and the Display and Crew Alerting Systems (DCA) for Boeing 787 and 777x.
After my co-op, I kept working for Collins part-time while enrolled in classes before moving to Arizona the following summer for an internship with __Raytheon Missiles & Defense__.
At Raytheon, I fixed bugs, vulnerabilities, and other weaknesses in embedded software identified by static analysis tools.
During the last year of my undergrad and first year of my graduate studies I completed two internships with __Arm's Architecture & Technology Group__ which I eventually joined full-time upon graduation.


## Research

My Master’s thesis, titled "Static and dynamic approaches to data mapping optimization in heterogeneous programs," focused on exploring program analysis techniques for improving the runtime performance and energy efficiency of HPC applications while simultaneously reducing development effort. 

Additionally, I published a paper in an __A*__ conference:

- __Luke Marzen__, Akash Dutta, and Ali Jannesari, "Static Generation of Efficient OpenMP Offload Data Mappings," in _Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis_, ser. SC’24, Atlanta, GA, USA: IEEE Press, Nov. 2024. DOI: [10.1109/SC41406.2024.00041](https://doi.org/10.1109/SC41406.2024.00041). (acceptance rate 21%)


## Open Source

I am an active contributor to the open-source community.
Notably, I built and maintain the popular [ESP32 E-Paper Weather Display](https://github.com/lmarzen/esp32-weather-epd), a highly configurable, embedded C/C++ IoT project for displaying weather forecasts on a low-power E-Paper display.
This project has an active community, achieving __5k__ GitHub stars, __300+__ forks, and contributions from over a dozen developers.
