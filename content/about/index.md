I am a Graduate Software Engineer at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/) and a recent Computer Science Master's graduate from Iowa State University.
My research interests include Program Analysis, Compilers, High-Performance Computing, and Computer Architecture.
I find enjoyment in exploring a myriad of hobbies.
I'm passionate about computers, open-source projects, 3D printing, mechanical keyboards, motorcycles, soccer, and hiking.

## Career

In January 2025, I began my current role with __Arm__ as a __Graduate Software Engineer__, working as part of the Raven Random Test Generator team.
Raven is a dynamic random test generator written in modern C++, widely used by CPU design teams across the Arm ecosystem for over a decade.
My work focuses on enhancing Raven's capabilities, designing and implementing new features, and supporting its use in verifying A, R, and M-class cores.
This role allows me to apply my skills in modern C++ and computer architecture knowledge while collaborating with engineers to tackle complex verification challenges.

<!-- Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to debug intricate issues, engage in technical discussions, and support users through training. -->

During my time in school I completed four interships/co-ops amounting to nearly two years of experience.
In May of 2021, I began my first co-op as a __Software Engineer__ at __Collins Aerospace__ in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
At Collins, I supported the verification effort of flight deck software for the Tuning and Control Panel (TCP-2100) and the Display and Crew Alerting Systems (DCA) for Boeing 787 and 777x.
After my co-op, I kept working for Collins part-time while enrolled in classes before moving to Arizona the following summer for an internship with __Raytheon Missiles & Defense__.
At Raytheon, I fixed bugs, vulnerabilities, and other weaknesses in embedded software identified by static analysis tools.
During my last year of my undergrad and first year of my graduate studies I completed two internships with __Arm's Architecture & Technology Group__ which I eventually joined full-time upon graduation.
