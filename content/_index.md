### Why I Write

Writing is a powerful tool for rationalizing one's opinions.  I write as a way to explore different points of view and share ideas I find interesting.  I think this excerpt best summarizes my motivations for writing.

> ...I have to write to discover what I am doing.  ...I don't know so well what I think until I see what I say; then I have to say it again.<br>
